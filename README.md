# KernelDriver
Another poor attempt at bypassing Epic's (Epic Online Services) Easy Anti-Cheat. (for VRChat, but can probably be used in other games)

I had no prior knowledge on anything needed to make this work (writing and reading memory, and more), so I'm learning on the go, and any help, in information or contribution are very welcomed.
So far I've managed to output from the Kernel Driver, it's not much but we're getting somewhere at least.
